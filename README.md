# D3.TEAM - Australia
Project #2 ,Visualize Me, Captain! with the D3.Team

## The D3.Team
The team consists of three data analysts, Stephen, Kom and Arvin. The team previously worked well as HappyCo and continued the dynamics into this second project. Stephen volunteered to project manage the team and produce the webpages required for this project. He setup the github repository while Kom and Arvin collaborate on it. Arvin volunteered to take on the technical documentation for the team and ensure it meets the expected level of professionalism. Kom is keen to explore the data available and produce some eye-catching UX. 

## The Page
The team reviewed the wikipedia page for Australia. This lead to the thinking of producing a website about Australia. The website will describe maps of different information about Australia. This will be about the climate, the geography and indigenous languages spoken in Australia. 

The second page will display statistical data about Australia. This will be about population, economic data and demographics.

The third page will display exciting infographics about Australia. 


## The Website
Stephen has successfully developed a website with 4 webpages. Each webpage showcases the different aspects of Australia, which is population, economics, demographics and interesting facts. 


## The Data
The team explored different sites and sources to understand Australia better. The wikipedia pages on Australia was a good guide to obtain further data. For demographics, the team used the wikipedia page and scrapped the data for further analysis. Arvin used pandas to scrap the data for this purpose. 

For economics and trade, the team managed to source information from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The data was available in Microsoft Excel format only for download. 

### The Web Scraping
Arvin used Pandas to scrap the tables of data from the wikipedia site. The data obtained was not readily available for use. He had to remove rows which did not contain data. He had to convert the type of data from objects to integers where neccessarry. 

## The Visualisation
Based on the data collected, the team was excited to display the visualisation. Kom inspected the data and proposed 5 different charts to visualise the impact of trade and economy on Australia. Kom would like to show the relationship of different countries with Australia through trade. He also intended to use one chart to explain imported good to Australia. He also used another chart to show exported goods from Australia and its destination. He also intended to show the largest trade surplus to Australia from its trading partners. He also showcased the largest trade deficit from Australia to its trading partners. 

As there was ample data from 1987, Stephen experimented with displaying the total goods exported from Australia. He made an interesting racing bar chart to display this information over time.
