# D3.TEAM - Australia
Project #2 ,Visualize Me, Captain! with the D3.Team

## The D3.Team
The team consists of three data analysts, Stephen, Kom and Arvin. The team previously worked well as HappyCo and continued the dynamics into this second project. Stephen volunteered to project manage the team and produce the webpages required for this project. He setup the github repository while Kom and Arvin collaborate on it. Arvin volunteered to take on the technical documentation for the team and ensure it meets the expected level of professionalism. Kom is keen to explore the data available and produce some eye-catching UX. 

## The Page
The team reviewed the wikipedia page for Australia. This lead to the thinking of producing a website about Australia. The website will describe maps of different information about Australia. This will be about the climate, the geography and indigenous languages spoken in Australia. 

The second page will display statistical data about Australia. This will be about population, economic data and demographics.

The third page will display exciting infographics about Australia.
