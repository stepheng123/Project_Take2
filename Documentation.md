## Australia's Economy at a glance
One of the key stories we'd like to share is Australia's economy. As a very large island nation, Australia is dependent on solid foreign relationships and trade. The team used various sites to explore the data on Australia's trade. 

One of the interesting dataset obtained during the exploration for this project was from the Department of Trade and Foreign Affairs. From this source, the team obtained a wealth of data about Australia and its trading partners since 1987. 

One interesting dataset was the balance of trade between Australia and its trading partners. The team used this historical data from 1987 to 2019 and plotted against a racing bar chart. This visual paints the story of Australia and its strongest top trading partners over time. 

The team then went on to develop further interesting visuals on Australia's economy. One key area is to understand Australia's economy for : 
  *Top Deficit
  *Top Surplus
  *Top Export
  *Top Import
  *Top Total




## Australians at a Glance

The next big factor about Australia is its population. The team found a multitude of sources describing the demography and population of Australia. The common source that summarized this data was wikipedia. 

Using web scraping techniques, the team web scraped the data from relevant wikipedia sites. The team also validated the information against its quoted source. Based on this, the team used jupyter notebook to build up basic charts for visual. The outcome of these visuals are displayed in this section.
